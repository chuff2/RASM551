TB ToDo

- Trigger Logic - Conner
- Channel Capture Logic - Adam (in progress)
- LA_dig (top level) - Consists of 5 tests outlined below split amongs everyone
- dig_core?? - Dont worry about until we find out that LAdig doesnt work
- post synthesis TB for one of our tests - Adam

Top Level TB tasks

- Reading and writing to different registers - Conner
- Reading a dump of channel RAM (and plot data using Keshavs plotting script) - John
- Testing channel triggering and protocol triggering, under different settings - Nick
	- create task PollCapDone - mentioned in the testing top level document on moodle
- Do we need to test the channel sampling? PWM? - Adam
	-set the VIH and VIL to certain values (max, 0 with respect to the ordering of the signals noted) and expect all X's 
	-set the VIH and VIL to half the range of the (.5*max, .5*max) so that nothing should be X


Other
-Synthesis script and post synth simulation (can use same top level test bench(s) from before) -Adam
-Mapping to DEO-nano - John


IMPORTANT: if anyone else has any more idea about what we should test, please let us know.
